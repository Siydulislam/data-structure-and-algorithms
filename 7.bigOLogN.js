// Big O notation is used to determine the performance of an Algorithm
// Big O notation gives us freedom to determine Time Complexity and Space Complexity
// We can determine the Time Complexity and Space Complexity with the help of Big O notation

// Comparision between Big O(log n) and O(1)

// Complexity of O(1) is less than O(log n)
// Takes a little bit more time in O(log n) than O(1)

// Complexity is more in Big O(n!)

// Complexity order =>
// O(1) < O(log n) < O(n) < O(n log n) < O(n^2) < O(2^n) < O(n!)

// The performance of an algorithm depends on Big O notation, not on hardware!
