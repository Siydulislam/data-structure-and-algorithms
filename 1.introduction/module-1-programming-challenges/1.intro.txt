// Introduction to Data Structures & Algorithms

Algorithms: Everywhere
- Writing a software
- Predicting traffic jam
- Products recommendation
- Analyzing genome
- Even, cooking your food
- Every branch of CS

But Efficient matters!!!
- A poorly designed algorithms: may take years...
- A well-designed algorithms: may do it in seconds...

Impacts in Data Science
- Google: How did it become the top search engine?
- Answer: Page Ranking
- Big Data: Predicting road accidents, Recommending movies to users
- Machine Learning: Simple linear regression to deep neural networks
- Exceeding human accuracy in vision and speech recognition

Challenge: Faster experiments with Big Data!!!

Applications in Genomic Science
- Genome sequencing: Biggest Jigsaw puzzle for mankind
- Finding mutations: what makes you and I different?
- Predicting diseases and drugs.
- Predicting functions of genes and proteins

What you will achieve here...
- Learn how to design efficient algorithms
- Lots of problems as programming assignments
- Implement, test and debug fast algorithms
- Solve large and difficult problems in seconds
- Surely become a better programmer
